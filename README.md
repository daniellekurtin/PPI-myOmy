# PPI-myOmy
This is a step-by-step guide for how to run a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) using FSL to determine changes in functional connectivity (FC). 

## Background on the study and data: 
This study is investigating the interactions among the parameters of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and the effects of stimulation on behavior, network activity, and FC. The parameters of stimulation include brain state (either task or rest state), stimulation polarity (anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation), and WM structure. 
This data consists of two participant groups: traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and healthy controls (HC). TBI patients are viewed as a model for impaired white matter (WM) structure, since TBI results in axonal injury, thus creating damaged WM tracts in the brain. 

This analysis focuses on changes in FC due to stimulation; specifically, it will us a PPI to determine the changes in FC, and how the parameters of stimulation (brain state, stimulation polarity, and WM strucutre) influence these changes.
